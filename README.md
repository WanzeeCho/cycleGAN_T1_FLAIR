# CycleGAN : T1 &leftrightarrow; FLAIR (unpaired data)

**Note** : This is a project related to the advanced big data assignment of Professor Kam Tae-eui's class in the spring semester of 2023.

### The purpose of this project is to **convert T1 images to FLAIR images or vice versa through image translation**.
            
The code here is based on pytorch and has no changes from the original CycleGAN.

T1 and FLAIR data are unpaired.
