# CycleGAN : T1 &leftrightarrow; FLAIR (unpaired data)

**Note** : This is a project related to the advanced big data assignment of Professor Gam Tae-eui's class in the spring semester of 2023.

### The purpose of this project is to **convert T1 images to FLAIR images or vice versa through image translation**.
            
The code here is based on pytorch and has no changes from the original CycleGAN.

The image has been compressed and uploaded under the name of 'dataset', and you can download this file.  
T1 and FLAIR data are unpaired.
